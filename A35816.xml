            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not the reſpect for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer if theſe Devotions, which I acknowledge to be very great, nor any thoughts of advantaging the Book-ſeller, for which I write this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but a pure and unintereſſed deſire to give ſome Account and Character of this Book, which in one dreſs or other, hath been ſent abroad no leſs than nine Times into the World.</p>
            <p>It hath had Four Editions unreform'd from the Roman Catholicks, in the laſt of which is added, <hi>The Office for the Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> which <hi>J. S.</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Dedicatory before the Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſures us, was begun by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Author before he died, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to annex it to his Devotions; and truly I cannot but wonder, who he
<pb facs="tcp:101478:3"/> was that durſt undertake to finiſh a Piece, that this <hi>Apelles,</hi> left imperfect, eſpecially after ſo great a Judge of Senſe and Style as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had ſaid that—<hi>It was ſo inimitably excellent, that ſcarce any would be found in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects able to match his Senſe and Expreſſion, or finiſh it as it ought.</hi> It hath had Five Editions more, as it was reformed by the Reverend and Worthy Mr. <hi>Dorrington,</hi> and a great part of it hath had divers other Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>ſtollen</hi> Books of Devotion, whoſe <hi>Mercenary</hi> Authors, have wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd their Names, leſt their ſhameful Practices ſhould be proved upon them. It now preſents it ſelf again in a new reform unto the World, in which I do not doubt but it will have many Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perhaps as many, as any Book of Devotion in what Language ſoever, except the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> ever had. For though Mr. <hi>Dorrington</hi>'s reform of it hath very well deſerved the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it hath found in the World, yet it was not altogether ſo acceptable to ſome diſcerning, as well as devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were skilful in divine Offices,
<pb facs="tcp:101478:3"/> and curious in the Theory, as well as conſtant in the practice of Devotions. Among theſe I have known not a few, who choſe to mark with their Pencils, whatever was amiſs in the unreform'd Devotions, that they might uſe them for their own private Benefit in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own Method, rather than in that of Mr. <hi>Dorrington,</hi> which in their Judgment was not ſo enflaming, nor fitted for the great and delightful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mutual and alternate Devotions, for which the divine Author (ſo I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but call him) ſeemed principally to contrive his Book, though it is no leſs fit for ſolitary Devotions, than that of Mr. <hi>Dorrington</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they objected, that Mr. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> had contracted the Four daily Offices into Two, that he had omitted the Leſſons; as many of which as are Scriptural, the devout Author of this Reform hath continued in the Verſion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that he had not reformed the Office for the <hi>Dead;</hi> that in the other he had left out many things, which they think as uſeful as any he hath taken in, together with the
<pb facs="tcp:101478:4"/> 
               <hi>Verſicles, Reſponſories,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons,</hi> as <hi>Such;</hi> with which the Pſalms make up that moſt venerable, edifying, and elevating way of alternate or ſocial Devotion, which was uſed in the beſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and truly reſembles the Worſhip and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the great <hi>Choire</hi> of Saints and Angels in the Church Triumphant, that moſt glorious <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to oblige thoſe devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who deſired another Reformation of thoſe Devotions, another is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them in the Author's own Way, from the Pen of a moſt Pious, as well as Ingenious and ready Writer, who hath not left out or altered any thing, but ſome few Sentences and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which hindered thoſe Offices from being introduc'd into the Cloſets and Oratories, of the more devout Sons and Daughters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe who delight in the more Heaven-like way of Worſhip; I mean in alternate or choral Devotion, which it is in the power of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Maſter, or Miſtreſs of a Family,
<pb facs="tcp:101478:4"/> or any two or more religious Perſons, who happen to live in the ſame Houſe, or Neighbourhood, or to Travel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Journey, to exerciſe themſelves in at vacant Times, to the Honour of God, whom they delight to Worſhip; the comfort and ſatisfaction of their own Conſciences, when they find their Souls ſo quickned, and delighted in bearing their Parts in ſuch harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Devotions; nay, to the unſpeakable inward Joy, and exultation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirits within them, which have raviſhing foretaſtes of Heaven in thoſe <hi>Heaven-like</hi> Exerciſes, which make this Life much more than other Devotions, reſemble that which is to come.</p>
            <p>But of all others, none have it in their Power to practiſe this moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of Worſhip in the Heaven like Fellowſhip of alternate Devotion, to ſo much advantage as the <hi>Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi> of whoſe Riſe and Progreſs, the World hath lately had an Account, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Poplar.</hi> It is to the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of theſe, and ſuch like Societies, that I particularly recommend this Book
<pb facs="tcp:101478:5"/> of Devotions, which in other forms, hath already more than once been recommended to the whole Chriſtian World. <hi>J. S.</hi> who I ſuppoſe is Mr. <hi>John Serjeant,</hi> in the Epiſtle Dedicatory, of the Second Edition, tells us, that it is the moſt ſubſtantial part of Divinity rendered uſefully Practical, the beſt Matter delivered in the beſt Manner, and that it neither needs nor courts any Man's Patronage to ſet it off, as being above all the Ends at which Dedications commonly aim, nay, above the World it ſelf, as conſining upon its neareſt Neighbour Heaven. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and moſt Worthy Mr. <hi>Dorrington,</hi> to whom the World is ſo much obliged for the firſt Reform of it, tells us, in the Epiſtle Dedicatory, that it is a Book very excellent in its kind, and worthy, as ſuch, to be recommended to the World; that it is fitted to poſſeſs Mens Minds with that pure and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wiſdom which is from above, to excite Devotion in the coldeſt, and moſt careleſs Hearts, nay, to poſſeſs with a love of Devotion, our too nice and witty Age, as being rational, ſolid, and ingenious in its higheſt flights. He
<pb facs="tcp:101478:5"/> thinks no Book of Devotion of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the ſame Communion comparable to it, and reformed from the Errors with which it was firſt compoſed; he thinks it as fit to poſſeſs Mens Minds with an affectionate, and powerful ſenſe of the Truths of Chriſtianity, as any Book that can be met with, unleſs any one will except <hi>the Expoſition of our Church-Catechiſm,</hi> compoſed for the uſe of the Dioceſs of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed farther in the Character of this Divine Book, I think fit to give ſome Account of its Offices, with ſome Directions about the uſe of them, which thoſe, who are not verſed in divine Offices, will not eaſily find out.</p>
            <p>Know then, It conſiſts of Eleven Offices; One for every Day in the Week, One for our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Feaſts, One for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> One for <hi>Saints,</hi> and One for the <hi>Dead,</hi> which the Author of this Reform hath entitled, <hi>A Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Office for Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Offices for every Day of the Week, though indeed they may be uſed on any other Day, are appropriated to
<pb facs="tcp:101478:6"/> their reſpective Days, not only for the ſake of Order or Method, but for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſons, upon which the great Author had his Eye in their reſpective Appropriations. This appears from the Offices themſelves; as in that for <hi>Thurſday,</hi> which is all upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> and its Inſtitution, becauſe on that Day our Lord before his Paſſion appointed that Holy Sacrament, and commemorative Sacrifice, to be a perpetual Memorial, or Commemoration before God, as well as among Men, of the great Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice he made upon the Croſs.</p>
            <p>The Subject of <hi>Fridays</hi> Devotions, are our Saviour's Sufferings, and our Redemption by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi>'s Office is upon the ſame Subject of our Lord's Sufferings, with a particular reſpect to the Victory he thereby obtained over Sin and Death, and the Powers of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Devotions are chiefly upon the Subject of our Lord's glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, with ſome Pſalms in it, which become the Chriſtian Sabbath, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's finiſhing the Creation, and
<pb facs="tcp:101478:6"/> reſting from all the Works which he had made.</p>
            <p>The Office of <hi>Monday,</hi> which was the ſecond day of the Creation, is all compoſed in the praiſe of God for the Works of Creation, and in celebrating his infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great Architect, who made the World with infinite Art in Number, Weight, and Meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi>'s Office is made in the Praiſe of God, as Preſerver and Suſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all that he hath Created, and particularly, as the Preſerver, and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi>'s Office is appointed to adore God, as the great Governour and Sovereign of the Creation, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points every Creature its proper Office, and guides all the Motions of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, according to his own infinite Wiſdom and Counſels, ſo as to bring about his own glorious Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The Office of our Saviour is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſet forth his Nature, as Mediator, and Redeemer, and the Praiſes of his infinite Love towards Men, in undertaking, and accompliſhing
<pb facs="tcp:101478:7"/> the great Work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Office of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is all in the Praiſe and Adoration of the Holy Spirit of God, the Third Perſon of the bleſſed and undivided Trinity, as He is our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> where, after aſſerting his eternal Proceſſion from the Father and the Son, and his equality with them in Glory, the Author celebrates his Praiſes in moſt divine Pſalms and Hymns, as the Author of our ſecond Birth, and glorifies him for all his Gifts, and Graces, and Comforts to the Sons of Men. More particularly for illuminating our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and ſanctifying our Wills, for helping us in our Prayers, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting us againſt Evil Spirits; finally, for being our Director, Guide, and Counſellor, for making our Bodies his Temples, and for finiſhing the Myſtery of our Redemption; withal, praiſing our Lord for ſending him in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Effuſions upon the Apoſtles punctually according to his Promiſe, and ſhewing how every Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity, as one co-infinite Goodneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to our Redemption, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
<pb facs="tcp:101478:7"/> agreed to compleat our Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>In the Office for the <hi>Dead</hi> every thing is ſaid that the Subject of Death, or our Preparation for it can require. There is ſet forth in moſt affecting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Miſery and Vanity of Man, as Mortal; the excellency of his better and immortal Part; the happineſs of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirits; the moderation with which we ought to temper and limit our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our dead Friends; how nearly it concerns us to ſecure our Peace with God before we die; with many things interſperſed, concerning the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the laſt Judgment, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and indiſpenſible Juſtice of God in inflicting Death without diſtinction, or reſpect of Perſons, upon all Sorts, Ranks, and Conditions of Men.</p>
            <p>In the Office of <hi>Saints</hi> are deſcribed in moſt devout manner the Sovereign Majeſty, and Glory of God, as King of Saints; and Angels, the Glories of the other State in the Kingdom of Heaven, the union of Prophets, Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Confeſſors, and all the Saints departed in one happy Fellowſhip, with
<pb facs="tcp:101478:8"/> Angels; and Seraphims; the wonderful Progreſs from Grace to Glory; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Goodneſs of God who rewards ſuch imperfect Services, and ſhort Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with infinite Rewards, and the obligation which lies upon us to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints departed with Honour, to commemorate and imitate their Virtues, to follow their bleſſed Examples, and reverently to obey the Church in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Feſtivals, which ſhe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to remember their Vertues, and recite their Sufferings for our own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, their Honour, and the Glory of God, to whom the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her excellent Office for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, firſt after the Reformation, did, in moſt Catholick manner, offer moſt high laud, and hearty thanks for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Graces and Virtues, which he had declared in all his Saints, and by them beſtowed upon his Church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World.</p>
            <p>Every one of theſe Offices hath Four Parts; and every one of theſe Parts may, as they are reformed in this Book, be performed in ſingle, or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Devotion in a quarter of an Hour,
<pb facs="tcp:101478:8"/> or little more, which make but a ſmall part of Time in every day to ſpend in God's Service, and may well be ſpared from our other common Employments, or from our vacant Hours, wherein we do nothing, or are apt to do ill, and are much better ſpent than in giving and receiving vain, idle, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Viſits, or waſting our precious Hours in places of publick, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reſort, or long, and tedious Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or fooliſh amuſements of our Thoughts, which ſo many times in the Day might be ſo nobly entertained with the ſublime, and ingenious Notions of this Book.</p>
            <p>Two of theſe Four Parts are allotted for the Morning, or Forenoon, and Two for the Evening or Afternoon, at ſuch Hours as every one may find moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for himſelf, if he is a ſingle Perſon, or as many Perſons agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may appoint with leaſt inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to themſelves. If a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon happens to be engaged unawares in Buſineſs, or Company, or to be in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or Voyage with others, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with his Book for one quarter of
<pb facs="tcp:101478:9"/> an Hour, into ſome receſs, in an Houſe, Garden, or Field; and a Maſter of a Family, that hath appointed Hours for Devotion, may order his Books to be laid at his appointed Hours, and invite his Friends who come in to join with him, if they are ſuch as he may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with, or they with him, or if not, with all Civility he may borrow ſo ſmall a part of an Hour of them, while he ſays his Prayers. This Cuſtom, if generally obſerved, would ſoon bring Religion, and Religious Perſons into Credit, Honour, and Veneration; and I hope no Man will be ſo uncharitable, as to think, that while I thus recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſet Hours of Devotion, I am ſo Superſtitious as to put any Truſt in the bare recital of a few Pſalms, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Hymns, at ſuch and ſuch preſcribed Times, but that I do it to reſtore the ancient practice of Devotion, which was in uſe among the Jews and the Primitive Chriſtians, among whom the diſtinction of Hours for Prayer was not the effect of Superſtition, but a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Inſtitution, in which they agreed as it were by common Inſpiration, as
<pb facs="tcp:101478:9"/> the beſt means of advancing Piety, and Devotion.</p>
            <p>Of the Four laſt <hi>Offices,</hi> that of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is to be uſed on all the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> in <hi>Advent,</hi> and the Feſtivals of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or New-Years-day, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> called among us, from the time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> the <hi>Twelfth-Day,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation, Paſſion-Sunday,</hi> which may be innocently obſerved, though not noted in the <hi>Church of England</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is to be ſaid on <hi>Whitſunday, Munday,</hi> and <hi>Tueſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office of <hi>Saints</hi> is to be uſed on all the proper Feſtivals, or days of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration for particular Saints, whoſe Offices are alſo here added by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Reformer of <hi>the Devotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office of the <hi>Dead</hi> is intended to be ſaid at diſcretion upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of epidemical Diſeaſes, and Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, upon the death of our Neighbours, Friends, and Relations, or upon the Anniverſary day of the death of any
<pb facs="tcp:101478:10"/> Perſons, whoſe Departures we think fit to Commemorate, as long as we ſurvive them; or ſometimes a devout Perſon may have occaſion, or inclination to ſay one or other of theſe Offices on any day of the Week, with great advantage, which may be done, omitting the proper Office of the day.</p>
            <p>As for directions in uſing theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, none are to be given to thoſe who uſe them alone; but they are wholly left to the government of their own diſcretions. But when two, or more ſay them together, it is fit they ſhould obſerve ſome Orders, and Rules in their ſocial Devotion, for which purpoſe I propoſe theſe which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the place, let it be ſome private Oratory, if any ſuch can be had, at leaſt ſome retirement, if the Houſe where they meet will afford any ſuch.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Mattins</hi> both falling down on their Knees, let them implore the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of God; <hi>A.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Prevent we beſeech thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> Then both ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, let them ſay together, <hi>In the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> Then let <hi>A.</hi> ſay the <hi>Invitatory,</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> repeat
<pb facs="tcp:101478:10"/> it every where as in the Book. Then both continuing ſtanding, let <hi>A.</hi> recite one Stanza of the Hymn, and <hi>B.</hi> the other, or rather ſing them if they have skill anſwerable to their Devotion. But if there be ſo many Perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to make a <hi>Choire,</hi> then they may be ſung in the Tunes of the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms, as Mr. <hi>Dorrington</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, <hi>viz.</hi> Hymn 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 28, 31, 39, in the more common Tunes; Hymn 7, 12, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33, 36, 38, 40. in the Tune of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth Pſalm; Hymn 10, 26, 29, 30, 35, 37. in the Tune of the Hundred and thirteenth Pſalm; and Hymn 19, 22, 33, 34. in the Tune of the Twenty fifth Pſalm. Then let <hi>A.</hi> ſay the Antiphon, and <hi>B.</hi> begin the Pſalm, which they are to recite alternately; or if they like it better, let the Antiphon be ſaid at the beginning and end of the Pſalm, and the Verſes of the Pſalm be read alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in the way of <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent practiſe of moſt Congregations of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which makes a moſt divine Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:101478:11"/> in Worſhip, betwixt the Prieſt and Chorus of the People. But the way of reciting the <hi>Antiphon,</hi> and the Verſes of the Pſalm alternately, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the Reformer, as well as the Author of the Devotions. The Primi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive Church had them both from the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> and there are many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of both to be found in the Book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> At the end of every Pſalm, let <hi>A.</hi> ſay, <hi>Glory be to the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>B. <hi>As it was in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> both continuing to ſtand, and ſhewing ſome other ſign of Worſhip by bowing the Head, or lifting up the Eyes to Heaven: For in all Devotion, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Worſhip is never to be neglected, and thoſe ſtiff, moroſe, and ſaturnine Votiſts, who are ſo ſparing of bodily Adoration, in our moſt ſolemn Services, refuſing to ſtand at the ſinging of Pſalms, and Anthems, or to bow to God before his Holy Altars, act not only againſt the common Notions of Mankind, and the Nature of divine Worſhip; but if they would obſerve it, againſt their own Inclinations, which if not reſtrained by falſe preconceptions, or warpt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:101478:11"/> to their bent, by perverſeneſs of Humour, and Education, would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prompt them, like other Men, to declare their inward by their outward Adoration, and join the Worſhip of the Body with the Devotion of the Soul. The Pſalms being ended, let <hi>A.</hi> read the Leſſons, and <hi>B.</hi> the <hi>Reſponſories;</hi> or rather let the <hi>Reſponſories</hi> be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Stars, as in the unreformed Devotions, and then let <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> read the parts of the <hi>Reſponſories</hi> ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed alternately in their turns. The <hi>Great Hymn,</hi> called <hi>TE DEUM,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed to be ſaid on <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holidays, at the end of the third <hi>Reſponſory,</hi> or indeed on any other day, when the Votaries pleaſe, and at the end of it, or the third <hi>Reſponſory,</hi> when it is not uſed, <hi>A.</hi> may conclude the <hi>Mattins</hi> with the ſolemn Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz. The Peace of God,</hi> &amp;c. But if he is not a Prieſt <hi>OUR</hi> is to be uſed inſtead of <hi>YOUR,</hi> and <hi>US</hi> inſtead of <hi>YOU.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Invitatory may ſerve to begin all the other parts of every Office, as well as the <hi>Mattins,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:101478:12"/> the ſame directions will ſerve to guide all devout Perſons in the uſe of them; and at any time, when unforeſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and buſineſs will not allow them to ſay them at diſtinct Hours, they may paſs immediately from the <hi>Mattins</hi> to the <hi>Lauds</hi> in the Morning, and from the <hi>Veſpers</hi> to the <hi>Complines</hi> in the Afternoon. And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that any other Prayers, or Forms of Prayer, for the Morning or Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the King, the Church, or our Friends, or Interceſſions for any other Perſons, or Petitions for Things; as alſo any Forms of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, may be uſed in any, or all the Parts of theſe Offices, as Prudence ſhall direct ſingle Perſons in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Devotions, or as Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, or Societies, who join together in ſocial Worſhip, ſhall agree among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to premiſe concerning the excellency of theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the uſe of them, and I hope no Friends to Piety, or Devotion will, through prejudice, or other human Weakneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, diſlike
<pb facs="tcp:101478:12"/> them becauſe they are <hi>Reformed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</hi> Far be this from any Man that would be thought wiſe, or good, leſt by the ſame Power of Prejudice and Paſſion, if God do not reſtrain him, he ſhould come to diſlike our pure Religion it ſelf, and its ſolemn Worſhip, becauſe they are both <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome among the Learned, as well as among the more common Sort, that are ſubject to ſuch Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> they are apt to think there are no true Fruits of Piety among thoſe of that Communion, nor any helps to Heaven can come from thence. But theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould conſider, that there are three ſorts of Men in that Church, who are not ſo accountable for the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Corruptions thereof. Some through the powerful Influence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and the invincible, or almoſt invincible Ignorance, that attends it, do not diſcern the great Faults of their Church, and God being merciful to ſuch Mens Miſtakes, gives them his holy Spirit, by the aſſiſtance whereof they
<pb facs="tcp:101478:13"/> bring forth the Fruits of true Piety; and among theſe we may find many Perſons eminent for Humility, Purity, Charity, Devotion, Gentleneſs, Self-denial, and Reſignation, and other Chriſtian Graces, and where we find Men in dangerous Communions, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt the dangers of them, by the ſpecial favour of God, we ought to magnifie his Goodneſs, and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ought to provoke us to emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to imitate the Patterns they ſet us in good Works.</p>
            <p>Some there are again, who knowing the controverted Doctrines, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of their Church, and the heavy Charges we juſtly lay upon them, yet through the modeſty and humility of their Tempers, joined with a credulous Charity, and great admiration they have for that Church, upon the account of ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">Such as Antiquity, a clearer Hiſtory of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, great extent over many Dominions, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Martyrs, being the Mother or Planter of many other Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> glaring, but accidental Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which other Churches want,
<pb facs="tcp:101478:13"/> they are unwilling to enter into a thorough Examination of the <hi>Points in Controverſie,</hi> thinking it the ſafeſt way to make no <hi>ſtrict Reſearches,</hi> but to deny their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings in ſome things, as they do their Wills in others, in ſubmiſſion to the Church's Authority, and to believe, as ſhe doth. This, as I gueſs, from ſome Expreſſions in the <hi>Thurſday-Office</hi> of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Devotions, was the Caſe of that humble and charitable Gentleman, who was the Author of theſe Devotions. He thought it hard to charge a Church of ſuch eminent Prerogatives with ſuch great Errors, and could not believe, that ſo great a part of Chriſtianity, as ſhe poſſeſſes, and ſo many guides of Souls, that are in her, ſhould all be in the Wrong. Thus his Modeſty and Charity to that Church made him forget the ſtate of the Jewiſh Church in the Reign of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and of the Chriſtian in the <hi>Arrian</hi> Reigns. Nevertheleſs, we ought to magnifie the abundant Mercy of God, who, in infinite pity to his miſtaken Humility, and too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="tcp:101478:14"/> Charity, was pleaſed to give him the Spirit of Devotion, with many other eminent Gifts, and Graces, of which we have an account in the Epiſtle Dedicatory to the <hi>unreformed Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> by <hi>J. S.</hi> which is left out of the Fourth Edition of them.</p>
            <p>Others there are in the third place, who though they are convinced of the dangerous Errors both in Doctrine and Practice of their Church, and that it ought to reform from them, yet think it better to bewail them in private, and daily praying for a Reformation, to bear with them till the happy time when the Church ſhall refosm it ſelf in Peace, and with Security to the Succeſſion, and Authority of the Prieſthood, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline, and Patrimony of the Church, and the juſt exerciſe of all her ſpiritual Powers, and Rights. Great Numbers of ſuch well diſpoſed Men are, and always have been in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince it needed to be reformed, and the Chriſtian World is beholden to many of them, for their admirable Works, which we are to embrace, with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:101478:14"/> to their Perſons, and Memories, and thankfulneſs to God, who gave them ſuch excellent Gifts. Theſe Men are none of thoſe, who ſend us in the <hi>lump</hi> to Hell, as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> though they think us not Reformed in that happy manner, that in love to the Church of God, and compaſſion to us, ſome of them ſeem heartily to wiſh. One of them writing of us not long ſince, ſaid, we are rather to be called <hi>Non-Catholicks</hi> than <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi> and though theſe Men do not come over to us, but think it beſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in that Communion, from which we had great reaſon to reform; yet it would be not only great weakneſs, but peeviſhneſs, and want of Chriſtian Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for us to refuſe to pay that Honour to their Perſons, or Memories, which is due unto them, upon the account: of their ſingular Gifts, or not give their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Writings, that acceptance they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, eſpecially when they are refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in commending the Author of the <hi>Devotions,</hi> and recommending this <hi>reform</hi> of them to the World, I
<pb facs="tcp:101478:15"/> hope, I have done nothing contrary to my Character, and the relation I bear to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to which I would to God every one that is of her Communion, wiſhed as well, as I do. I am ſure ſuch Books, as this, will do her no harm, but very much good, though it comes from a Member of a Church, that will never be Friends with us for reforming from her, till God ſhall give her Grace to reform her ſelf. I have commended it purely for its Worth, and Excellence, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the account whereof, I am not aſhamed to declare, that I intend to uſe it my ſelf, and make it one of my Companions whereſoever I go, as being, in my Judgment, a Book of Devotion, which contains very great variety of ſublime, and uſeful Thoughts in the moſt proper, pure, and plain Language, and joineth the higheſt flights of Devotion, with Liturgical Gravity, in a ſeraphick, but ſober Style. Indeed, I think it a juſt Pattern for Chriſtian Devotion in all its Offices, being accommodated with great exactneſs of Compoſure to devout
<pb facs="tcp:101478:15"/> Perſons of all Tempers, and made, not only to excite, but to govern, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Devotion. It not only raiſes the dull, and quickens the ſluggiſh, and warms the frozen Spirits, but tempers the fervour of <hi>over-hot</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and ſecures them with great Art againſt the <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> of their Tempers, and from running into the frenzy, and rapturous Exceſſes of the <hi>myſtical Devotion.</hi> Wherefore this Book being wiſely and curiouſly ſuited to Religious Perſons of all Diſpoſitions, and Tempers, I have, I hope, without deſerving any Cenſure, preſumed to recommend it to Maſters of Families, and to Religious Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and Societies; in the laſt of which, there muſt be Votaries of all ſorts. Among the former I commend it more eſpecially to thoſe, who cannot have the benefit of Publick Inſtruction in the Churches, or who cannot have it ſo duly, and conſtantly, as the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of their Families require. Such are they, who live at a great diſtance from Churches, to which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb facs="tcp:101478:16"/> is difficult in the Winter. Such alſo who have the misfortune to live in the Spiritual Deſarts, which Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege hath made in many Places, where, for want of Maintenance, there is an inſufficient Clergy, or it may be none all. And laſtly, Such who happen to live in <hi>Spiritual Deſarts,</hi> of another Nature, in <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Mahometan</hi> Countries, or in Chriſtian Countries of another Communion, to whoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies they cannot go. The uſe of this Book, in ſuch deſtitute Families, will not only teach the Children, and Servants how to pray in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but alſo inſtruct them in all the Doctrines, and Duties of Chriſtianity, and in a great meaſure ſupply the want of going to Church. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Maſters of Families, in theſe unhappy Circumſtances, to be, as far as they can, Prieſts in their own Families; and thoſe who think fit to uſe this Book, by the benefit of it will with great eaſe, make their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks truly knowing Chriſtians; and if to the daily uſe thereof they pleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:101478:16"/> to add, on the Lord's-Day, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church Catechiſm, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the <hi>R. R.</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kettlewell</hi>'s <hi>Practical Believer,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Monitor,</hi> they will, in great meaſure, make up the loſs of Parochial Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and throughly furniſh their younger Dependants unto all Good Works.</p>
            <p>Among the latter, I have more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly commended it to thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Societies,</hi> of which the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> hath given us an Account. They cannot, in my Opinion, better Sanctifie the Lord's-Day in their Families, or Meetings, for which they worthily profeſs ſo great a Zeal, than by the <hi>Sunday-Office</hi> of this Book. They cannot better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for the Worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Holy Communion, to the frequent Reception of which they devoutly oblige themſelves, than by reading the <hi>Thurſday-Office</hi> thereof, in their Meetings, or in their Cloſets. And as they often meet together to
<pb facs="tcp:101478:17"/> Diſcourſe on Spiritual Subjects, ſo they will no where find more, or more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subjects of that nature, than in this little Volume; which will alſo anſwer the Orders they have made, to bind themſelves to pray many times every day, and to read pious Books for their Ediucation. In ſhort, it is a Book fitted for their <hi>Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> and <hi>Devotions;</hi> and if at any time they think fit to uſe its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the <hi>Stewards</hi> who preſide in their Meetings, may do the part of <hi>A.</hi> in the Directions above given, and the reſt making a noble and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious <hi>Chorus,</hi> may perform the part of <hi>B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this while I have been ſpeaking of the Book, I had almoſt forgot the devout Reformer of it, who is one that hath a mighty <hi>genius</hi> for Divinity; and though never bred in Scholaſtick Education, yet by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with learned Clergy-Men, and reading the beſt Divinity Books, hath attained to a Skill in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Science, not much inferiour to
<pb facs="tcp:101478:17"/> that of the beſt Divines. It is one who hath already given the World one Book of Devotions, which hath been well received in Three, or Four Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will leave it another, for which Poſterity will bleſs the Author's Name; one whoſe Houſe is a Temple, and whoſe Family is a Church, or Religious Society, and whoſe Hands are daily lifted up unto Heaven, with Alms, as well as Prayers; one whe Religiouſly obſerves all the Orders of the Church, that concern the People, and wiſhes, that thoſe were better obſerved, which concern the Prieſts; one who more particularly keeps with moſt exact Obſervance, all the Faſts and Feſtivals of the Church, and for the great Ends for which they are enjoined; in a word, One who is a great Example of Chriſtian Piety, and a ſingular Ornament to our <hi>Communion,</hi> in this degenerate Age; and among the many and moſt ſerious good Wiſhes I have for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> this
<pb facs="tcp:101478:18"/> is, and always ſhall be one, that all her Sons and Daughters were Such.</p>

                     <p>THE beginning of Wiſdom is the true deſire of Diſcipline; the care of Diſcipline is Love, and Love is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Laws, and the keeping of her Laws is the accompliſhment of Incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and Incorruption makes us next to God; therefore the deſire of Wiſdom leads to an everlaſting Kingdom: If then you be delighted with Thrones and Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptres, ſeek Wiſdom that you may reign for ever.

Our Lord is only theirs that expect him in the way of Truth and Juſtice. The Higheſt allows not the Gifts of the Wicked, nor regards the Oblations of the Unjuſt, nor pardons their Offences for the multitude of their Sacrifices.
